                <p>I may have not ever known Yui, but the replies here clearly show how much of an impactful, kind and amazing person she was. I wish the best for her family and friends and may she rest in tranquility in heaven.</p>

                <p>May Yui rest in peace :( I wish I had known her and spoken to her. She seemed like a lovely person</p>

                <p>I am also one of those who did not know Yui but if she were still alive I would love to let her know that she is not alone that has experienced the same things as she did. I’m sure she was a really nice person overall but to be honest nobody deserves to go through such thing…</p>

                <p>I didn't know yui other than one post, I only knew her friends. She seemed like such a wonderful person and did not deserve to get manipulated and harassed as she did. I hope that she's happy wherever she is in now.</p>

                <p>I had only known of the situation days ago and didn't know much about the persons but hearing that someone died from it truly saddens me. I wish yui to find her peace, she deserves it after everything she had been through and sincerely hope those who had hurt her pays the price of their actions against an innocent angel.</p>
                <p>Rest in peace Yui, you will be missed by everyone <3 </p>

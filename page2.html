                <p>We’re dealing with the loss of a great soul, Yui, in the gentle embrace of eternity’s flow. Your absence has left a void that no words can fill. Rest now, Yui, in the comfort of Tranquility. Let your presence be equally serene as your fondness for us. Your legacy will live on in the lives of those you touched, and we will forever keep your spirit within us, finding solace in the memories we shared. Rest in everlasting serenity till we reunite together on the other side. I am truly sorry for your loss, Yui’s close friends and family. Please accept my heartfelt sympathies.</p>
